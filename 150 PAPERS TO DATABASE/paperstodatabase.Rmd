## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

library(dplyr,dbplyr)
library(RMariaDB)
library(DBI)
connection <- dbConnect(RMariaDB::MariaDB(), 
                        dsn="mysql",
                        Server = "localhost",
                        dbname = "papers", 
                        user = "root", 
                        password = '')

```

```{r}
dbListTables(connection)
```

```{r}
dbListFields(connection,"150_papers")
```

```{r}

dbWriteTable(conn = connection, name = "150_papers", value = papers, append = TRUE)

```

```{r}

empi_data <- dbGetQuery(connection, "SELECT * FROM 150_papers")

glimpse(empi_data)
```

```{r}
empi_data[c(1:10),]
